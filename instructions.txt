It is called showmoor like showroom:
here are the links which need treatments:
and every link with the screenshot from macbook 15 so that you know how it does originally look like
(until you make it responsive or I will)

1 http://showmoor.com
2 http://showmoor.com/showjob.html
3 http://showmoor.com/showroom.html
there are still few pages like upload, welcome page etc.
But here are the most important 3 ones and before I send you an html I'm showing you it so that you analyze it
first page is good : just maybe improve its code and make it faster
second page is good : just maybe improve its code and make it faster and also make the search function you know what I mean:
to search a job

//--------------------------------------------
hi back,
so for all pages:
they all must be improved and responsive at least for Pcs sizes, they are in HTML,
no design must change but would be favourable  if you can improve the code behind,
make the site fast and use HTML5.

for the first and second pages
for the functions:


1. First page:
- only a show page that must display (full screen) the first image of the profile images,
- the name of the designer
- the number of the creative room (down left)
- the work of the designer,
- the day it is published
- the actual day (today) up right.

2. Second page : it shows the date of today (up right), an artwork,
the name of artist and a link to that page.
And the main content is jobs.
That appear with one filter (latest) with a search possibility on the left that allows users to search.
The job link to the job poster agency or to a page depending on what the poster has chosen,
and all the jobs are similar:
job title,
full/part time or freelancer,
city of the job location,
apply button,
description and
a non visible category unless a user search (I will give you a list of the creative fields you must put)
.We will add a job posting page as well.
